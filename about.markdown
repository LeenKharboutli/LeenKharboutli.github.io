Hello! I'm a data professional and engineer with a background in mathematics. My professional experience has been primarily in building explainable AI ([XAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence)) applications for clients. 

In my own time, I've developed projects that demonstrate my enduring interest in using technology to solve problems. A project I'm particularly excited about now is [The Third Place](https://github.com/LeenKharboutli/the-third-place), a social media platform meant to help users find and build IRL communities!

Beyond tech, I enjoy philosophy, music production, and shuffling.
